# Student Management System

## Project Overview

The Student Management System is a Python-based project designed to efficiently manage student data using file handling and exception handling techniques. This system is structured with a separate main file that calls various functions to perform operations such as adding, updating, deleting, and retrieving student records.

## Features

- **File Handling**: The project uses file handling to store and retrieve student data persistently.
- **Exception Handling**: Robust error handling ensures smooth execution even when unexpected issues arise.
- **Modular Code**: The project is organized with a main file that calls specific functions, making it easy to manage and update the codebase.

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: The entry point of the application, handling the overall workflow.
- `student_database.py`: Contains functions for adding, updating, deleting, and retrieving student records.
- `exceptions.py`: Handles custom exceptions and error management.
- `data/`: A directory containing student data files.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/student-management-system.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd student-management-system
    ```
3. **Run the main file**:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Future Enhancements

- Implementing a GUI for better user interaction.
- Adding advanced search functionality.
- Integrating a database for more scalable data management.
